##  Configuration Management using Ansible for Node.js Backend Deployment

This guide focuses on the "Configuration Management" aspect of the project using Ansible. We'll assume you have Ubuntu servers with password authentication set up, configured with SSH key authentication as described in the previous guide.

Here's a breakdown of the steps with resources for configuring your servers for a Node.js backend deployment:

### 1. Ansible Inventory:

Create a file named `inventory` in your Ansible project directory. List your server IPs or hostnames, one per line. (e.g., `server1.example.com`, `server2.example.com`)

Here's an example inventory:

```
[servers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com
```

### 2. Create an Ansible Playbook:

* Create a file named `nodejs_deploy.yml` in your project directory.

Here's a basic playbook template:

```yaml
---
- hosts: servers
  become: true  # Gain root privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Update package lists
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: Install required packages
      apt: name={{ item }} state=present
        with_items:
          - nodejs
          - npm

    - name: Create a directory for the Node.js app
      file:
        path: /var/www/nodejs_app
        state: directory
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data

    - name: Copy the Node.js application code
      copy:
        src: ./nodejs_app/  # Replace with your app directory
        dest: /var/www/nodejs_app/
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data

    - name: Install Node.js dependencies
      npm:
        path: /var/www/nodejs_app/
        production: yes  # Install production dependencies

    - name: Configure Nginx for the Node.js app
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2  # Replace with your Nginx template file
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644

    - name: Enable the Nginx configuration for the Node.js app
      file:
        src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        state: link
        owner: root
        group: root

    - name: Restart Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted

  # Add additional tasks for environment variables, etc.

```

**Explanation:**

* This playbook follows a similar structure as the Django example.
* It updates package lists, installs Node.js and npm, creates a directory for the application, copies the code, installs production dependencies using npm, configures Nginx using a template, and restarts the service.
* Adjust paths and file names based on your project structure.

**Additional Resources:**

* Ansible Modules: [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-doc.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-doc.html)
* Jinja2 Templating for Nginx configuration: [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_templating.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_templating.html)

### 3. Run the Playbook:

* In your project directory, run the following command to execute the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook nodejs_deploy.yml
```

This will connect to your servers, execute the tasks, and configure them for your Node.js application deployment.

**Remember:**

* This is a basic example. You may need additional tasks for environment variables, security configurations specific to your project, and potentially database setup depending on your application requirements.
* Test your playbook on a single server first before running it on all servers.

By following these steps, you can use Ansible to configure your Ubuntu servers for deploying your Node.js backend application.
