##  Configuration Management using Ansible for Django Backend Deployment

This guide focuses on the "Configuration Management" aspect of the project using Ansible. We'll assume you have Ubuntu servers with password authentication set up.

Here's a breakdown of the steps with resources for configuring your servers:

### 1. Install Ansible on your Control Machine:

Ansible is agentless, meaning you only need it installed on the machine controlling your servers (control machine). Here's how to install it on Ubuntu:

* **Resource:** [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html)

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install software-properties-common
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```

### 2. Set Up Ansible Inventory:

* Create a file named `inventory` in your Ansible project directory.
* List your server IPs or hostnames, one per line. (e.g., `server1.example.com`, `server2.example.com`)

Here's an example inventory:

```
[servers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com
```

* You can also group servers based on roles (e.g., `[db_servers]`, `[web_servers]`).

### 3. Create an Ansible Playbook:

* Ansible playbooks are YAML files defining tasks to be executed on servers.
* Create a file named `django_deploy.yml` in your project directory.

Here's a basic playbook template:

```yaml
---
- hosts: servers  # Use your server group or all servers
  become: true  # Gain root privileges for tasks
  tasks:
    - name: Update package lists
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: Install required packages
      apt: name={{ item }} state=present
        with_items:
          - python3-pip
          - python3-dev
          - nginx

    - name: Create a directory for the Django app
      file:
        path: /var/www/django_app
        state: directory
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data

    - name: Copy the Django application code
      copy:
        src: ./django_app/  # Replace with your app directory
        dest: /var/www/django_app/
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data

    - name: Install Python dependencies
      pip:
        requirements: /var/www/django_app/requirements.txt  # Replace with your requirements file

    - name: Configure Nginx for the Django app
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2  # Replace with your Nginx template file
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644

    - name: Enable the Nginx configuration for the Django app
      file:
        src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        state: link
        owner: root
        group: root

    - name: Restart Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted

  # Add additional tasks for database setup, environment variables, etc.

```

**Explanation:**

* `hosts`: Specifies the server group or all servers.
* `become: true`: Gains root privileges for tasks.
* `tasks`: Defines a list of tasks to be executed.
  * Each task has a `name` for reference.
  * Modules like `apt`, `file`, `copy`, `pip`, `template`, and `service` are used for specific actions.
  * Adjust paths and file names based on your project structure.

**Additional Resources:**

* Ansible Modules: [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/module.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/module.html)
* Jinja2 Templating for Nginx configuration: [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_templating.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_templating.html)

### 4. Run the Playbook:

* In your project directory, run the following command to execute the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook django_deploy.yml
```

This will connect to your servers, execute the tasks, and configure them for your Django application deployment.

**Remember:**

* This is a basic example. You may need additional tasks for database setup, environment variables, and security configurations specific to your project.
* Test your playbook on a single server first before running it on all servers.

By following these steps, you can use Ansible to
